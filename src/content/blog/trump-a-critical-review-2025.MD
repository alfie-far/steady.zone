In a world unraveling at its seams, where civilians are shot dead for queuing up for bread in Gaza and the entire cities in Ukraine are flattened under the illusion of ceasefire diplomacy, one man still believes that performative posturing is a strategy.

In a world unraveling at its seams, where civilians are shot for queuing up for bread in Gaza and entire cities in Ukraine are flattened under the illusion of ceasefire diplomacy, one man still believes that performative posturing is a strategy.

Donald Trump’s recent proclamations on “ending all wars” sound less like statesmanship and more like campaign-season sloganeering — stripped of empathy, stripped of complexity, and devoid of any grasp of realpolitik. In Gaza, starvation is being used as a weapon. In Ukraine, peace can’t be dictated by someone who refuses to understand that Putin’s war machine won’t stop until it extracts a symbolic — if not territorial — victory. Trump, meanwhile, calls for quick-fix ceasefires as if wars are just business deals waiting to close.

But this moment isn’t just about him. It’s about what we’ve normalized. In Mein Kampf, Hitler lays out a blueprint: inflate national pride, create an “us vs them,” promise restoration of greatness, and rally the disillusioned behind a single enemy. America heard echoes of that in “Make America Great Again” and “America First” — slogans steeped in nostalgia and built on the backs of immigrants, minorities, and outsiders. When you strip the historical context away, nationalism always sounds noble. But history has warned us: it rarely ends that way.
