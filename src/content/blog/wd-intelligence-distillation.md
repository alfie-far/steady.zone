    This blog post explores the paradox of intelligence in an era of limitless information.
    Despite having unprecedented access to information, modern minds are often clouded by excess of info, rather than being sharpened by insight.
    True intelligence doesn’t come from accumulating more; on the contrary, it comes from strategically forgetting, shedding, and distilling.
    Drawing parallels between celestial bodies, human cognition, and digital information overload, the post examines how intelligence,
    refines its path by letting go of unnecessary weight. It argues that in a world flooded with data,
    the real challenge is not what we remember, but what we choose to delete. Something that
    shapes clearer thinking, sharper judgment, and a more focused mind.

Imagine walking on a beach. Every step leaves a footprint, but the waves eventually wash them away. You keep moving forward, 
leaving traces behind, but never carrying the entire path with you. That’s how intelligence effectively works. It's done not by holding onto everything, but by keeping what’s useful and letting go 
of the rest. This got me thinking about the way we process information. The more we forget about specific details, the more uncertain we become about the past. 
But maybe that’s not a flaw but maybe it’s a necessity. Intelligence isn’t about just storing knowledge; it’s about refining it as well. Like a planet moving through space, 
bending the fabric of reality as it goes, our minds carve pathways, shed unnecessary weight, and adapt.



Now imagine intelligence as a moving body; never still, always refining, always shedding! It is similar to a planet bending space-time as it drifts, like a snake peeling off its old skin, 
intelligence isn’t just about gathering information. It’s about letting some of it go away. We tend to think of intelligence as accumulation—the more we know, the better we think. But real 
intelligence works differently. It moves forward by forgetting, by distilling, by deleting what no longer serves a purpose. 
This isn’t just true for human thought—it’s a universal pattern, echoed in the very structure of reality.
