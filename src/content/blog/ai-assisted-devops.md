    Once deployed, the software is operated and continuously monitored to maintain performance and address any issues or unexpected failures.

## Introduction
The DevOps cycle represents a set of practices and processes that facilitate continuous delivery and integration 
of software, ensuring efficiency and reliability in development and operations. In its purest form, it has eight 
key phases: **Plan**, **Code**, **Build**, **Test**, **Release**, **Deploy**, **Operate**, and **Monitor**. 
This continuous loop ensures efficient and reliable software development and operations. Every iteration begins 
with preparations and planning to define objectives and requirements, followed by coding and building the software. 
The new versions are then tested rigorously to ensure quality before the software is released and deployed to production. 
Once deployed, the software is operated and continuously monitored to maintain performance and address any issues or unexpected failures.
This iterative process promotes agility, collaboration, and rapid delivery of high-quality software systems.

In recent years, a significant amount of research and development has been focused on defining methodologies, team topologies, 
and enterprise integration patterns to ensure successful execution of the DevOps cycle within product teams. These teams are typically 
composed of numerous small groups, each contributing to one or more of the phases, ensuring a seamless transition between issues and responses 
throughout the project lifecycle.

### What is Generative AI
Historically, AI was used to understand and recommend information. Now, generative AI can also help us create new content. 
Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can generate high-quality text, code, images, and other content based on 
the data they were trained on. Generative AI builds on existing technologies, like large language models (LLMs) which are 
trained on large amounts of text and learn to predict the next word in a sentence. For example, "peanut butter and ___" is 
more likely to be followed by "jelly" than "shoelace".

Introducing Generative AI to your DevOps cycle can offer several benefits and further enhancements to your process. 
Starting from where it ends, in the Monitoring phase, your events, service logs and alerts could be analysed to monitor performance, 
detect anomalies, and report potential issues before they become critical. In the same sense, there are lots of AI powered services 
to assist your team during the Planning & Coding phases; for example if your change management system is integrated with these tools, 
they will be able to read, understand and propose possible changes/ solutions to the raised issues inside tickets. The assisted coding 
experience is also another valuable resource which could help patching and fixing bugs at production faster. In Build & Test phase, 
generative AI or trained models can automate and enhance testing procedures to provide higher accuracy and faster feedback loops. 
Furthermore, your CICD pipeline should rely on autonamous agents to review release candidates and bridge the gap between the release and 
deployment time.
