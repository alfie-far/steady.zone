## Introduction
The DevOps cycle represents a set of practices and processes that facilitate continuous delivery and integration 
of software, ensuring efficiency and reliability in development and operations. In its purest form, it has eight 
key phases: **Plan**, **Code**, **Build**, **Test**, **Release**, **Deploy**, **Operate**, and **Monitor**. 
This continuous loop ensures efficient and reliable software development and operations. Every iteration begins 
with preparations and planning to define objectives and requirements, followed by coding and building the software. 
The new versions are then tested rigorously to ensure quality before the software is released and deployed to production. 
Once deployed, the software is operated and continuously monitored to maintain performance and address any issues or unexpected failures.
This iterative process promotes agility, collaboration, and rapid delivery of high-quality software systems.
