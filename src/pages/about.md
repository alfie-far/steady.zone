## Personal Bio

I am a tingle of anticipation, an evolutionist, engineer, architect, researcher,
software programmer, innovator, network administrator, diagram aficionado, logophile,
junior horologist, watch collector, MMA fan, math lover, bird lover and a backgammon prodigy.
I've probably forgotten a few more here but at least these are the ones that I could think of,
at the time of writing this!

I love to see systems work in harmony at scale; just like how the universe works
out its expansion plan. I admire simple ideas that demonstrate a potential for growth and
keen to be a force for their development. I think there are many principles and disciplines
from other domains of knowledge that can be applied to computer system designs to help build more
robust systems.

I am steeped in the science and art of development and delivery of commercial, financial, operational
IT and cybersecurity SaaS products. I have been designing and building software
systems professionally for more than 10 years now. Some that succeeded and
some that didn't, nonetheless there is always lessons learned for me and that's
what I love the most about my job!

I have also used and studied many other systems, both successes and failures. I believe there is a lot of benefit
in learning from others and in appreciation of this opportunity I have dedicated this weblog to share my stories
and experiences with all the community to be a small part of this culture of sharing.
