## Personal Bio

I am a tingle of anticipation, an evolutionist, engineer, architect, researcher,
software programmer, innovator, network administrator, diagram aficionado, logophile,
junior horologist, watch collector, MMA fan, math lover, bird lover and a backgammon prodigy.
I've probably forgotten a few more here but at least these are the ones that I could think of,
at the time of writing this!

I love to see systems work in harmony at scale; just like how the universe works
out its expansion plan. I admire simple ideas that demonstrate a potential for growth and
keen to be a force for their development. I think there are many principles and disciplines
from other domains of knowledge that can be applied to computer system designs to help build more
robust systems.

I am steeped in the science and art of development, delivery and operational execution of commercial, financial
and cybersecurity SaaS products. I have been designing such solutions and building software
systems professionally for more than 10 years now. Some of them succeeded and some that didn't, nonetheless,
I always found lots of hints and takeaways in the progress of building such systems.

I have also used and studied many other systems, both successes and failures. I believe there is a lot of benefit
in learning from others and in appreciation of this opportunity I have dedicated this weblog to share my stories
and experiences with all the community to be a small part of this culture of sharing.
